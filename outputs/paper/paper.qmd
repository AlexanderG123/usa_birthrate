 This study investigates homicide trends in Toronto from 2004 to 2020, utilizing data from OpenDataToronto. The data shows a fluctuating increase in homicide rates over the city, with most homicides occurring in a relatively small subset of neighbourhoods. Additionally, the data shows the prevalence of gun violence, a surprising result in a country known for its strict gun control laws. This research is significant as it provides insights into urban violence in a major Canadian city. It contributes to the understanding of urban crime dynamics in the Greater Toronto Area.
